# Abstract
 Despite being beloved pets, cats pose significant threats to wildlife through predation and competition. Existing legislations struggle to mitigate these impacts, highlighting the need for effective communication strategies. This study surveyed 150 university students to investigate how different visual representations of domestic cats—categorized as cute, scary, dirty, or neutral—affect recall of positive, negative, or neutral information about cats. We hypothesized that negative and dirty representations would enhance recall of negative information, while cute representations would enhance positive recall. Contrary to expectations, no significant effect of visual representations on information recall was found. Results suggest strong emotional bonds with cats may buffer negative imagery. Exploratory analyses indicated that individual factors, like having a cat allergy, reduced recall of positive information. These findings show the complexity of altering public perception about positively perceived animals like cats.
