Furthermore, the application of orthogonal contrasts is an alternative way of doing statistical analysis on data from non-conventional experiments, whithout a definite structure. To justify its application, an extensive review is made on the definitions and concepts involving contrasts.},

abstract={The greater power of bad events over good ones is found in everyday events, major life events (e.g., trauma), close relationship outcomes, social network patterns, interpersonal interactions, and learning processes. Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bad is stronger than good, as a general principle across a broad range of psychological phenomena.},

  abstract = {Arndt and Hirshman (1998) used MINERVA 2 to simulate true and false recognition in DRM-style lists and found that the model was able to capture many features of the empirical data. Here, we first replicate their simulations, but using empirically structured vectors derived from Latent Semantic Analysis rather than the randomly generated vectors characteristic of MINERVA 2. We report that the model still captures the DRM effect with fewer free parameters. We then extend our analyses to true and false recognition for full sentences and metaphorical expressions. Using a simple bag-of-words representation for sentences, we find that the MINERVA 2 model captures classic sentence false recognition findings from Bransford and Frank (1971) and a more recent finding from Reid and Katz (2018a) that demonstrates false recognition of unstudied sentences that share a metaphorical but not literal theme to studied sentences. These simulations provide evidence that an instance-based memory model, when amalgamated with structured semantic representations from a distributional semantic model, can account for true and false recognition across different types of language experiences.},
